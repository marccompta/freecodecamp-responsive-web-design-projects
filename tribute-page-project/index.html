            <h2>Who is Batman?</h2>
            <p>
                Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character
                was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in Detective Comics #27
                in 1939. Originally named the "Bat-Man," the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped
                Crusader, the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective.

                Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne
                Enterprises. His origin depicts Bruce Wayne as a child, after witnessing the murder of his parents Dr.
                Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of
                justice. Bruce Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to
                fight crime.

                Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance from various supporting characters,
                including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike
                most superheroes, Batman does not possess any inhuman superpowers. He does, however, possess a
                genius-level intellect, is a peerless martial artist, and his vast wealth affords him an extraordinary
                arsenal of weaponry and equipment. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery,
                including his archenemy, the Joker.

                The character became popular soon after his introduction in 1939 and gained his own comic book title,
                Batman, the following year. As the decades went on, different interpretations of the character emerged.
                The late 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the
                character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark
                roots, culminating in 1986 with The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. The success of Warner Bros.
                Pictures' live-action Batman feature films have helped maintain the character's prominence in mainstream
                culture.
